# Project Overview

## Project Description

I will be creating an interactive website highlighting free views of NYC. None of these views require a ticket or have an entry fee, but some require a metrocard purchase. The site will consist of two pages (I think), the homepage and an About page. I will have a graphic design of all the burroughs with smaller graphics of each viewpoint designed by my designer friend.<br><br>
When a user hovers over the image of the viewpoint, an informational box (or full page, but leaning toward box) will appear that contains:<br>
1) The name of the viewpoint<br>2) Slideshow carousel of my images<br>3) Directions and tips on how to access the viewpoint and surrounding touristy sites<br>4) The current weather at viewpoint<br>5) A Google map that automatically detects the visitor's location and determines the fastest route to viewpoint <br><br>
I currently have a total of 13 viewpoints but am working on narrowing this list down! I am obsessed with views of NYC from all angles and I hope this site will inspire people to venture out to a viewpoint they've never been to. This site will be designed to be easily buildable.<br><br>
This past GA Gallery project is similar to what I am looking to create: [Seattle History That Matters](http://seattlebackstory.com/)<br><br>
I am hoping to create this using a graphic design of NYC, but using Google Maps and creating my own informational pop-ups might be a cleaner and more accurate option.  


| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| [Seattle History that Matters](http://seattlebackstory.com/) | - Points clearly marked with corresponding pop-ups.   |  
| [Weather App Codepen](https://codepen.io/kristyan-p/pen/jaVYwZ) | - two-toned color scheme <br> - clean design and simple structure  |  
| [Weather App Codepen 2](https://codepen.io/ziggysauce/pen/RZboVE?limit=all&page=3&q=weather+app) | - white on color look <br> - white borders  |  
| [GA Gallery - Cat Ghost](https://kristinefrancisco.github.io/cat-ghost/) | - cute, clean graphics<br> - color scheme<br> - buildable design<br> - blank background w/ lots of whitespace |
