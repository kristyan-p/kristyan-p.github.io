# Project Overview

## Project Description

I will be creating an interactive website highlighting free views of Manhattan both in and out of Manhattan. None of these views require a ticket or have an entry fee, but some require a metrocard purchase. The site will consist of two pages (I think), the homepage and an About page. I will be using Google Maps as my homepage background with the viewpoints selected.<br><br>
When the visitor comes to the site, a questionnaire will appear as an overlay to the homepage and will direct visitors through a series of Yes/No questions that will lead them to a curated viewpoint.<br><br>
This viewpoint will be highlighted in some way or a pop-up (see below) will automatically appear. All other viewpoints will still be on the map.<br><br>
When a user hovers over the image of this viewpoint or a different one, an informational box (or full page, but leaning toward box) will appear that contains:<br>- The name of the viewpoint<br>- Slideshow carousel of images, both mine and pulled from iStock or some other image rights website<br>- My own tips on how to access the viewpoint and surrounding touristy sites/food options<br>- The current weather at viewpoint<br>- A Google map that automatically detects the visitor's location and determines the fastest route to viewpoint <br><br>
I currently have a total of 14 viewpoints but may add more. I am obsessed with views of NYC from all angles and I hope this site will inspire people to venture out to a viewpoint they've never been to!<br><br>
This past GA Gallery project is similar to what I am looking to create: [Seattle History That Matters](http://seattlebackstory.com/)<br><br>
I am thinking of using [Snazzy Maps](https://snazzymaps.com/) to create my custom Google map. While I am relying on Google Maps for the background of my homepage because of its accuracy and comprehensiveness, the majority of my coding and programming will involve the questionnaire overlay, the html and css of the pop-up boxes and About page, and the weather and location APIs. I will incorporate javascript throughout to enhance the user experience and presentation.

## MVP 
- Quiz that appears as an overlay when the page is opened that leaders visitors through a series of Yes/No questions to result in one spot they should visit<br>
- API for weather and Google maps (functionality to take your current location and automatically generate directions?)<br>
- Automatically generating directions from visitor's current location to viewpoint

## POST MVP
- Ability for people to check off which viewpoints they have been to or add their own photos/submit suggestions for their favorite spots to be added<br>
