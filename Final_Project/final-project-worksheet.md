# Project Overview

## Project Description

I will be creating an interactive website highlighting free views of NYC. None of these views require a ticket or have an entry fee, but some require a metrocard purchase. The site will consist of two pages, the homepage and an about page. I will have a graphic design of all the burroughs with smaller graphics of each viewpoint designed by my designer friend.<br><br>
When a user hovers over the image of the viewpoint, an informational box will appear that contains<br>1) The name of the viewpoint<br>2) Directions on how to access the viewpoint<br>3) A Google map<br>4) Slideshow carousel of images<br>5) Tips/tricks/ and nearby food options or tourist attractions.
