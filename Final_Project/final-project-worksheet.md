# Project Overview

## Project Description

I will be creating an interactive website highlighting free views of NYC. None of these views require a ticket or have an entry fee, but some require a metrocard purchase. The site will consist of two pages (I think), the homepage and an about page. I will have a graphic design of all the burroughs with smaller graphics of each viewpoint designed by my designer friend.<br><br>
When a user hovers over the image of the viewpoint, an informational box (or full page, but leaning toward box) will appear that contains:<br>
1) The name of the viewpoint<br>2) Directions on how to access the viewpoint<br>3) A Google map<br>4) Slideshow carousel of my images<br>5) Tips/tricks/ and nearby food options or tourist attractions.<br><br>
I currently have a total of 15 viewpoints but am working on narrowing this list down! I am obsessed with views of NYC from all angles and I hope this site will inspire people to venture out to a viewpoint they've never been to! This site will be designed to be easily buildable.
